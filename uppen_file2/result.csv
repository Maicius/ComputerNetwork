								I am currently the Zhang Jindong Professor of Operations, Information and Decisions at the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School.  My central research area is on the relationship between information technology and productivity and the factors that affect the value of IT investments. Most of my recent work has been the study of complementary factors, such as organizational design and human capital, on the value of IT. Most of this work is directed at firms in all industries, although I have become increasingly interested in IT deployment in healthcare. In recent years, we have been more extensively working on the role of the IT workforce and issues that affect the demand and wages of IT workers (such as offshoring and the H1-B visa program). I have also been extensively involved in electronic business research investigating the the nature of competition in electronic markets (such as on-line travel agents), the value proposition for alternative delivery systems (such as online retail banking), the role of switching costs in determining pricing and product strategy (as in online discount brokerage), and the effect of recommender systems on consumer behavior.
I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in information systems management and economics and data analysis.  I also teach the undergraduate core class in OPIM in the Fall (off-season).
In my spare time, I also consult and conduct research into the design of IT outsourcing agreements, methods for evaluating IT investments, and other questions at the intersection of information systems, economics and econometrics. I also occasionally serve as an expert witness for information technology and consumer-related litigation (intellectual property, consumer behavior in computers and consumer electronics industries, enterprise software, and software project problems).

								Rachel Arnett is an Assistant Professor of Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
Her research investigates the important role that identities and interpersonal interactions play in cultivating workplace inclusion and enabling professional advancement. In her primary stream of research, she examines when, why, and how individuals express cultural identities or conceal relatively high status identities when interacting with people who differ from themselves, and the influence that these decisions have on employees’ inclusive behaviors towards one another and willingness to promote one another’s professional advancement. While primarily an experimentalist, her research also employs field and qualitative methods. Through her work, she hopes to shed light upon how people from different backgrounds can work together effectively and drive organizational success.
​
Rachel completed her doctoral training in Harvard University’s Organizational Behavior program, an interdisciplinary program between Harvard Business School and Harvard’s Social Psychology department. Before Harvard, she was a Research Assistant in New York University’s Social Psychology department and a Senior Brand Strategist in the advertising industry.

								Winston (Wei) Dou’s research focus lies at the intersection of finance, macroeconomics, and econometrics, in particular the impact of economic uncertainty, the role of market imperfection and incompleteness, the interactions of international asset prices and capital flows and their roles in understanding global imbalances, and new econometric methods for analyzing structural models. His articles have appeared in the Annals of Statistics and Journal of American Statistics Association. His research has received multiple academic awards.
One of his recent research projects quantitatively and empirically investigates how heightened economic uncertainty affects asset prices and investment. Intuitively speaking, economic uncertainty is the blurriness or randomness of firm-specific economic prospects. Interestingly, he finds that, in the model as in the data, uncertainty is not always fearfully evil as the economy has experienced around the late 2000s financial crisis; in fact, it can sometimes be welcomed and embraced by investors.
He joined Wharton in 2016 as an assistant professor of finance. Previously, he studied financial economics at MIT. He also received another doctoral degree in statistics from Yale University in 2010. He obtained a B.S. in mathematics and another B.S. in economics from Peking University in China.

Much of this research has uses Internet data sources to measure skills and labor market activity at novel levels of granularity. His published papers have analyzed data from online job sites, data aggregators, and other labor market intermediaries that generate large databases of fine-grained information on workers’ skills and career paths or on employers’ job requirements. He is a co-author of “The Talent Equation: Big Data Lessons for Navigating the Skills Gap and Building a Competitive Workforce,” published by McGraw Hill in 2013.
His research has been published or is forthcoming in a number of academic journals including Management Science, Information Systems Research, MIS Quarterly, The Review of Financial Studies, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, Communications of the ACM, and Information Economics and Policy and it has been supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

								Professor Raghu Iyengar’s research interests fall in two domains: pricing and social influence. In the area of pricing, his work focuses on the impact of multi-part pricing schemes on consumer response. The success of such pricing mechanisms to extract consumer surplus depends on how consumers respond to different components. Methodologically, Iyengar has developed novel consumer demand models that capture the effect of multi-part pricing tariffs in a theoretically meaningful way and include contextual factors such as consumers’ uncertainty about usage. Substantively, he has shown that accounting for consumers’ uncertainty is important for firm profits especially when multi-part prices are employed. In the area of social networks, Iyengar has done work that has investigated how and why such influence may be at work. Across several studies, Iyengar has identified the underlying mechanism(s) such as awareness, social learning or social normative pressure that may be at work in different contexts. Understanding the mechanism(s) is important not only theoretically but also managerially, because which customers to target and which ties to activate using what message depends on what mechanism is at work.
Professor Iyengar’s other current research projects focus on the impact of referral coupons on consumer behavior and how changes in loyalty program requirements may change future customer behavior. His research has been published or forthcoming in Journal of Marketing Research, Marketing Science, Psychometrika, Quantitative and Marketing Economics and Experimental Economics. He serves on the Editorial Boards of Journal of Marketing Research, Marketing Science and the International Journal of Research in Marketing.
Professor Iyengar’s teaching interests are in the area of Marketing Analytics. He earned his PhD and MPhil from Columbia University and his B. Tech. from IIT Kanpur, India.

Research Interests:
My research explores how cognitive processes, namely the mental processes by which individuals interpret situations, and acquire and process information, drive strategic decision-making and strategic interactions. Be it at crucial decision making points such as mergers and acquisitions or expansions, during periods of strategic innovation and change, or when competing with other firms, differences across strategic leaders in these cognitive processes can lead to significant performance differences across the firms. My research investigates some of the ways in which these processes can vary across decision makers, and how these differences affect performance. Thus, it provides a different, cognitive lens with which to understand persistent performance differences across firms, the central issue in strategy.

								Herbert Hovenkamp has been named the University of Pennsylvania’s 21st Penn Integrates Knowledge University Professor, effective July 2.
The announcement was made today by Penn President Amy Gutmann and Provost Vincent Price.
A world-renowned scholar of antitrust law and policy, Hovenkamp will be the James G. Dinan University Professor, with joint faculty appointments in the Law School and in the Department of Legal Studies and Business Ethics at the Wharton School.
“Herb Hovenkamp is an exceptionally influential scholar of international renown who brings wide-ranging expertise at the intersection of law and business to Penn,” said Penn President Amy Gutmann. “He is a prolific highly-cited author whose work informs key decisions in antitrust law and policy. His unique command of complex issues at the global interaction of law, business, patents and innovation will bolster Penn’s acknowledged leadership in these areas, presenting wonderful new opportunities to foster collaboration and integrate knowledge across disciplines. Professor Hovenkamp epitomizes the uniquely collaborative and multidisciplinary skill sets of our PIK professors, and we are thrilled he is joining Penn’s eminent faculty.”
Called “the dean of American antitrust law” by The New York Times in 2011, Hovenkamp received the John Sherman Award from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice in 2008, awarded a few times a decade for “outstanding achievement in antitrust law, contributing to the protection of American consumers and to the preservation of economic liberty.”  He is currently Ben and Dorothy Willie Professor at the University of Iowa College of Law, where he has taught since 1986, and coauthor of the landmark 21-volume Antitrust Law, which has been cited more than 50 times by the Supreme Court and more than 1,000 times by federal courts.
A Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Hovenkamp has been a Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation and the American Council of Learned Societies at Harvard Law School, Presidential Lecturer at the University of Iowa and the recipient of the University of Iowa Collegiate Teaching Award. Among more than a hundred articles and a dozen books, his Enterprise and American Law, 1836-1937 (Harvard University Press, 1991) received the Littleton-Griswold Prize of the American Historical Association, and Science and Religion in America, 1800-1860 (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1978) received the Choice Award. He earned a J.D., Ph.D. in American Civilization and M.A. in American literature from the University of Texas following a B.A. from Calvin College and taught from 1980 to 1985 at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.
“Herb Hovenkamp will be a tremendous catalyst for our eminence in antitrust and patent law,” Price said. “He is not only a globally acclaimed scholar but also a renowned teacher and mentor. I am confident that his expertise will have a major impact on our students in law, in business and across the University.”
The Penn Integrates Knowledge program was launched by Gutmann in 2005 as a University-wide initiative to recruit exceptional faculty members whose research and teaching exemplify the integration of knowledge across disciplines and who are appointed in at least two schools at Penn.
The James G. Dinan University Professorship is the gift of James G. Dinan, a 1981 graduate of the Wharton School of the University.  Dinan founded York Capital Management, a New York-based investment firm in September 1991 and is the chairman, the chief executive officer and a managing Partner of the firm. He is a University trustee and a member of the Wharton Board of Overseers.

								My research interests are at the intersection of Operations, Marketing, and Economics, and focus on the study of new online business models. The advent of Web 2.0, together with the widespread diffusion of smart portable devices, have transformed the way customers shop and interact both with firms and with each other. In more and more industries, online platforms have emerged to facilitate–and regulate—both B2C and C2C interactions (Groupon, Kickstarter, Uber, Instacart, etc). These changes have brought with them a host of new challenges, and opportunities, for all parties involved. Platforms need to understand how to best design the ‘rules of the game’ to attract more users, minimize incentive conflicts, and encourage truthful information reporting. Businesses and customers need to understand the real benefit of participating to these new business models, and how to best leverage platform rules to their advantage. Governments need to understand the consequences of a clash between these new online business models and more traditional businesses, and the consequent impact on social and environmental welfare. Improving the understanding of these issues, and attempting to provide an answer to them, is the focus of my research.

								Ulrich Doraszelski is the Joseph J. Aresty Professor and Professor of Business Economics and Public Policy at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also a Professor of Economics at the School of Arts and Sciences and a Professor of Marketing at the Wharton School. He received his Ph.D. in Economics from Northwestern University in 2001. Professor Doraszelski has previously been a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a faculty member of the Department of Economics at Harvard University. He currently serves as Associate Editor for Operations Research, Quantitative Economics, and the Rand Journal of Economics. He previously served as Co-Editor for the International Journal of Industrial Organization.
Professor Doraszelski’s research identifies and explains the long-run impact of firms’ strategic decisions on the evolution of an industry. Many decisions such as investments in capacity and research and development are long-lived and affect both current and future profitability. They also have profound consequences for the competitive position of a firm vis-a-vis its rivals and shape the structure of the industry. These changes in industry structure in turn affect the future decisions of firms. Professor Doraszelski’s overarching research interest is to investigate, both theoretically and empirically, this two-way link between firms’ strategic decisions and the evolution of the industry over time.
Professor Doraszelski’s research has been published in leading academic journals including the American Economic Review, Econometrica, the Journal of Political Economy, the Rand Journal of Economics, and the Review of Economic Studies. Professor Doraszelski is the recipient of numerous grants from the National Science Foundation. He was a National Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University from 2006 to 2007.

								Natalya Vinokurova is an Assistant Professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research focuses on understanding how decisions get made in the real world and how these decision-making processes evolve in situ over time. Using a combination of historical analysis and ethnographic methods, she studies patterns of decision-making in contexts ranging from heart surgery and mortgage-backed securities to nuclear power. Her dissertation investigates how the use of analogical reasoning facilitated both the development and the collapse of the market for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the United States.

								Professor Stephanie J. Creary is an identity and diversity scholar and field researcher. She is also an affiliated faculty member of Wharton People Analytics and a Senior Fellow of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics (LDI). Her research program is motivated by understanding how different strategies for managing multiple identities, perspectives, and experiences shape career-related outcomes and the performance of work-related activities. Specifically, she investigates: (1) how individuals and groups minimize the conflict that can ensue when their differences become more salient; (2) how they navigate pressures to conceal, reveal, or downplay valued aspects of themselves at work, and (3) the organizational features and relationship qualities that enable and constrain these dynamics. In addition, she has developed a new course, “Leading Diversity in Organizations” and teaches that to Wharton undergraduate and MBA students.
Prior to joining the Wharton faculty, Professor Creary was on the faculty of Cornell University. Prior to completing her PhD degree, she was a research associate at Harvard Business School and The Conference Board in NYC researching corporate diversity and inclusion practices. She also has extensive work experience in the health care industry. Professor Creary has earned B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Boston University Sargent College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences; an MBA degree from Simmons School of Management; and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Boston College Carroll School of Management.

								Aline Gatignon is an Assistant Professor of Management at the Wharton School. She completed her Ph.D. in Strategic Management at  INSEAD, and previously received a M.A. in Development Economics and a B.A. in Political Science from the Paris Institute of Political Science (Sciences Po).
Her research explains how firms can partner with nonprofit organizations and government bodies to address problems at the intersection of public and private interests (e.g., lack of education creating labor market failures, regulatory uncertainty around the use of natural resources). Her work sheds light on the mechanisms through which such cross-sector collaborations can successfully create both public and private value. As those mechanisms often cross multiple levels of analysis, her research connects individuals, the organizations they belong to and the institutional environments they operate in.  The empirical settings that Aline studies include cosmetics in Brazil,  healthcare partnerships in Africa, Corporate Social Responsibility in India, as well as last-mile logistics and corporate disaster response worldwide.
Alin’s research and pedagogical case studies on this topic have been recognized with several awards, including the Strategic Management Society Best PhD Paper Award and the European Foundation for Management Development case study competition award. Her work has been listed as part of INSEAD’s “50 Years, 50 Women, 50 Ideas” series. She currently serves on the Editorial Board of the Strategic Management Journal.

Organizational leadership is the act of influencing employees from various teams, units, and other groups to achieve a common purpose. By extension, two key challenges of leadership involve (1) establishing a common purpose and then (2) orchestrating the efforts of a multitude of groups toward that purpose. I investigate unanswered questions related to both topics. In particular, I focus on why leaders sometimes take actions that backfire (for example, attempting to resolve conflict but then inadvertently escalating it), as well as how leaders can avoid these unintended consequences.

								Paul Nary is a faculty member at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. He is a strategy researcher who is interested in how firms, especially those in high-tech settings, reshape their boundaries and source capabilities externally. His current work spans two closely related research streams. In the first stream, Paul studies how firms source capabilities by engaging in multiple external corporate development modes, such as alliances, acquisitions, and corporate venture capital investments, while paying special attention to choice and interdependence of these modes. In the second, complementary stream, he investigates the distinct roles of various types of external investors (whether other firms, PE funds, or VC investors) and their investments, both when it comes to their roles in the markets, as well as their influence on firm-level and transaction-level outcomes. Paul’s research contributes primarily to literatures at the intersection of corporate strategy, entrepreneurship, and technology and innovation management. Paul is a Strategic Management Society’s SRF Dissertation Scholar and an Interdisciplinary Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Minnesota, where he is conducting archival research at the Charles Babbage Institute. Most recently, he was a recipient of Wharton’s Mack Institute Research Fellowship. Paul currently teaches the Strategy module in the core MBA course: Managing the Emerging Enterprise (MGMT 612).
Prior to his academic career, Paul worked for Intel Corporation, where his work spanned corporate venturing, new business development, mergers and acquisitions, and external technology collaborations. Before Intel, he worked for a boutique PE firm, a commercial real estate investment fund, and started two small businesses.
Paul is completing his PhD in Strategic Management and Entrepreneurship at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. He also holds a Master’s degree from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, and an MBA and a B.S. in Finance from DePaul University.

								Robert Meyer is the Frederick H. Ecker/MetLife Insurance Professor and Co-Director of Wharton’s Risk Management and Decision Processes Center.  He is a noted scholar whose research focuses on consumer decision analysis, sales response modeling, and decision making under uncertainty. Professor Meyer’s work has appeared in a wide variety of professional journals and books, including the Journal of Consumer Research, the Journal of Marketing Research, the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, Marketing Science, Management Science, and Risk Analysis. He is currently Senior Editor for journals of the American Marketing Association, and was former editor  of the Journal of Marketing Research and Marketing Letters.  He also served as an associated editor for  the Journal of Consumer Research, the Journal of Marketing,   and Marketing Science.  He has also served on the editorial review board of several major journals.
Professor Meyer’s recent research has focused on a range of topics in decision making and communication  in the domains of consumer research and natural hazards preparedness.   This work includes the use of natural-language processing tools to study how sensationalist news stories develop and spread on social media platforms, and how warnings messages are  perceived by residents faced with natural disaster threats.  For example, Professor Meyer and his colleagues have been able to show that failures of  preparation that often precede catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina, Sandy, and the 2008/09 housing and equities collapse are consistent with a number of hard-wired biases in how people respond to risk. This includes a tendency for people to fail to learn as much as they should from near-misses, and under-invest in instruments whose value can only be realized in the long run.  These ideas form the basis of his recent book, co-authored with Howard Kunreuther,  the Ostrich Paradox: Why we under-prepare for Disasters.
At Wharton Professor Meyer has served as chair of the Marketing Department and  Vice Dean of Wharton’s doctoral programs. His teaching interests include courses in New Product Management, Research Methods, and Marketing Strategy, which he has taught at the MBA, executive MBA, and doctoral levels. He is also an active participant in a number of Wharton’s executive education programs.
Professor Meyer joined the marketing faculty in 1990 after spending eight years on the faculty of the Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA, and two years at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie-Mellon University. He also held appointments as  visiting professor in the school of Business Administration at the University of Miami, the University of Sydney, and the University of Tokyo.

Stew’s most recent book is Leading the Life You Want: Skills for Integrating Work and Life (Harvard Business, 2014), a Wall Street Journal best-seller.  It builds on his award-winning best-seller, Total Leadership: Be a Better Leader, Have a Richer Life (Harvard Business, 2008), which has been translated into many languages. The program it describes is his challenging Wharton course, in which participants complete an intensive series of real-world exercises designed to increase their leadership capacity and performance in all parts of their lives by better integrating them, while working in high-involvement peer-to-peer coaching relationships and completing much of the activity online in a cutting-edge social learning environment.  Total Leadership is used by individuals and companies worldwide, including as a primary intervention in a multi-year study funded by the National Institutes of Health on improving the careers and lives of women in medicine and by 135,000+ students who were enrolled in Stew’s highly-rated MOOC on Coursera.
In 2001 Stew concluded a two-year assignment as a senior executive at Ford Motor Company, where he was director of the Leadership Development Center (LDC), running a 50-person, $25 MM operation.  In partnership with the CEO, he launched a corporate-wide portfolio of initiatives designed to transform Ford’s culture; 2500+ managers per year participated.  Near the end of his tenure at Ford, an independent research group (ICEDR) said the LDC was a “global benchmark” for leadership development programs.
Stew worked for five years in the mental health field before earning his PhD in organizational psychology from the University of Michigan.  He has published on work/life, leadership, and the dynamics of change, including the widely-cited Harvard Business Review articles, “Work and life: the end of the zero-sum game” (1998); “Be a better leader, have a richer life” (2008); and “Work+Home+Community+Self (2014); and “The Happy Workaholic: a role model for employees” (in Academy of Management Executive, 2003).  In 2013 Wharton Digital Press published his landmark study of two generations of Wharton students, Baby Bust: New Choices for Men and Women in Work and Family. Work and Family – Allies or Enemies? (Oxford, 2000) was recognized by the Wall Street Journal as one of the field’s best books.  In Integrating Work and Life: The Wharton Resource Guide (Jossey-Bass, 1998) Stew edited the first collection of learning tools for building leadership skills for integrating work and life.
Stew serves on a number of boards and has advised a wide range of companies and public sector organizations, including the U.S. Department of Labor, the United Nations, and two White House administrations.  He gives keynote addresses and conducts workshops globally on leadership and the whole person, creating change, and strategic human resources issues. (Here is the master class he gave for Wharton’s Lifelong Learning Tour in San Francisco.)

								Professor Tyler Wry studies hybrid ventures, which are organizations that combine related, but potentially contradictory aims in their core. For example, many nanotechnology startups are organized around the joint pursuit of scientific discovery and technology commercialization, and social enterprises work to generate profits while simultaneously addressing societal issues. These organizations have the potential to generate important commercial and social innovations, but also face a number of unique challenges, particularly in the startup stage of development. Building on this, Tyler’s research focuses on how hybrids emerge, attract resources, and positively affect society.
Tyler’s work has appeared in outlets such as the Academy of Management Annals, the Academy of Management Journal, the Academy of Management Review, the Journal of Business Venturing, and Organization Science. He serves on the Editorial Boards of Administrative Science Quarterly, the Academy of Management Journal and the Academy of Management Review. In his spare time, Tyler enjoys running, racquet sports, and fleeting moments of quiet.

Dr. Silber holds the Nancy Abramson Wolfson Endowed Chair in Health Services Research at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and is a Professor of Pediatrics and Anesthesiology & Critical Care at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and Professor of Health Care Management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.  He is a Senior Fellow at the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.
Dr. Silber is an internationally known authority on outcomes measurement and severity adjustment for both adult and pediatric applications. He created the adult quality of care measure Failure-to-Rescue (FTR) in 1990 that has been adopted as three specific quality measures by the National Quality Forum (NQF). He has also developed two length of stay outcome measures: Prolonged Length of Stay and Conditional Length of Stay, now applied to both pediatric and adult populations. With Paul Rosenbaum he developed the Omega measure that evaluates outcome measures by estimating the relative contribution of patient to hospital characteristics associated with a specific outcome, and the method of Template Matching to compare hospital cost and quality.  He has published extensively on all aspects of the theory of outcomes measure and model development and validation, as well as the applications of outcomes measures to pressing public health issues.  Much of his recent work focuses on the use of multivariate matching when comparing outcomes, specifically with respect to problems in both pediatric and adult medicine and surgery, disparities, and cancer. Dr. Silber has twice been awarded the Article of the Year Award in Health Services Research from AcademyHealth, the leading professional organization concerning Health Services Research in the U.S.
Dr. Silber helped to establish and has served as the Director of the Center for Outcomes Research since its inception in 1997.  The center is a multidisciplinary health services research hub for Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania investigators and external academic and institutional collaborators which aims to improve health outcomes through the development, testing and application of innovative, practical metrics which serve as tools to transform the quality and efficiency of health care.
Dr. Silber teaches two courses at the University of Pennsylvania:  HCMG212 – Health Care Quality and Outcomes:  Measurement and Management at the Wharton School and EPI580 – Outcomes Research at the Perelman School of Medicine.

								Professor Exequiel (Zeke) Hernandez is the Max and Bernice Garchik Family Presidential Assistant Professor. He studies how firms strategically use formal and informal external relationships to internationalize, innovate, and enhance their performance. His research is motivated by a pervasive managerial challenge: firms do not own all the resources they need to be successful and thus have to reach beyond their organizational and national boundaries to get them. This leads firms to establish external relationships with collaborators and rivals, domestically and internationally. Zeke’s research explores how firms strategically access and manage these external relationships (i.e. their antecedents) and how such relationships affect globalization, innovation, and performance (i.e. their consequences).
Zeke’s research has three main themes. The first explores how immigrants function as conduits of knowledge that facilitate the foreign expansion and performance of firms. The second focuses on how networks and institutions jointly affect the innovation outcomes firms get from cross-national knowledge partnerships (e.g. R&D alliances). The third considers how firms strategically use corporate strategies (acquisitions, divestitures) to reshape the structure of their alliance networks, to enhance access to novel resources and protect existing resources. Zeke’s research has been published by top tier journals such as Administrative Science Quarterly, Management Science, Organization Science, Strategic Management Journal, and Academy of Management Journal. 
Zeke was recently selected as the winner of the Emerging Scholar Award by the Strategic Management Society (2018), the Strategic Management Division of the Academy of Management (in 2017) and the International Management Division of the Academy of Management (in 2016). These awards recognize “a relatively young or new scholar, who displays exemplary scholarship that promises to have an impact on future strategic management practice.”
In addition to these career recognitions, Zeke has received awards for papers representing each of the three themes of his research. His work on the relationship between immigration and the internationalization of firms has been recognized with multiple awards, most recently the Temple/AIB Best Paper Award by Academy of International Business. His studies on how firms can strategically use acquisitions to better position themselves in alliance networks have been given best paper awards by the Strategic Management Society and by the Academy of Management. And his research on how institutions affect firm’s ability to access global innovation networks has been nominated for a best paper award by the Strategic Management Society.
In his teaching, Zeke strives to apply cutting edge research to the current opportunities and challenges faced by managers in an increasingly complex and contentious global environment. He teaches the global strategy course in all of Wharton’s MBA programs (full-time, EMBA, and JDMBA) and has trained executives from leading companies around the world. He has been recognized for teaching excellence by three different universities, most recently receiving the “Goes Above and Beyond the Call of Duty” (2018) and the Teaching Commitment and Curricular Innovation awards (2017) in the Wharton full-time MBA program.
Zeke received his PhD from the University of Minnesota in 2011. Before joining Wharton, he was a professor at Washington University in St. Louis.

								Objectives and strategy: Following Benjamin Franklin’s objectives for the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Armstrong strives to discover and disseminate useful knowledge. He uses experimental evidence to compare alternative reasonable hypotheses to identify management principles and techniques. In April 2015, he was the subject of an “Alain Elkann interview of thought leaders” on why his approach to research often leads to surprising findings.
Research Findings: Armstrong has been associated with colleagues in developing and testing 91 useful findings for 17 areas, including: market-share objectives harm profits, formal planning improves profitability, mandatory disclaimers harm consumers, mandated programs for corporate social responsibility are detrimental, high remuneration for CEOs harm stockholders, and peer review by scientific journals slows scientific development.). He also developed and tested “Extrapolation-by-Waves” (the widely-used method to correct for nonresponse bias in surveys), the Forecasting Audit, the Seer-Sucker Theory, the Index Method, the Golden Rule of Forecasting, and the Persuasion Principles Index. His research on forecasting climate change led to the conclusion that there is no scientific forecast to support the hypothesis of dangerous manmade global warming, and to his bet with former Vice President Al Gore (see theclimatebet.com). (The complete list of findings is on his resume.) Despite many counterintuitive findings in his studies, no substantive errors have been discovered . . . yet.
Research impact: Scholars often read and use Armstrong’s research. In April 2016, his Google Scholar Citations numbered over 28,000 with an h-score of 65, and 154 papers with ten or more cites. In addition, the Social Science Research Network’s measure of “impact on researchers” put him in the top 0.1% of roughly 330,000 researchers listed on the site in 2017. Google News lists 200 articles related to his research. He has testified before a U.S. Senate committee and a U.S. House Committee on issues related to global warming. Armstrong’s papers and books are widely read. There are about 85,000 downloads of his papers per year from the Scholarly Commons, and he is in the top 0.4% for annual downloads from the SSRN.
Publications: Research Gate lists about 400 publications for Armstrong. He authored Long-Range Forecasting and the Principles of Forecasting Handbook. His book, Persuasive Advertising, was a finalist for the American Marketing Association’s “Best Book in Marketing” in 2011.
Founder: He is a cofounder of the Journal of Forecasting, International Journal of Forecasting,  International Institute of Forecasters, International Symposium on Forecasting, and PollyVote.com. The latter has provided the most accurate forecasts for U.S. Presidential elections since its launch in the 2004 election. He founded ForecastingPrinciples.com and AdvertisingPrinciples.com, as ways of learning about evidence-based principles and techniques via the Internet. The advertising site received MERLOT’s 2004 award as the “Best Internet Site in Business Education” and it is ranked #1 of the 286 advertising sites reviewed by MERLOT. In 2016, Kesten Green and he founded the Iron Law of Regulation Website, an evidence-based approach to to summarize experimental evidence on the effect of regulations on the general welfare.

								Professor Mary-Hunter (“Mae”) McDonnell received her Ph.D. in Management and Organizations from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, a J.D. from Harvard Law School, and a B.A. in Philosophy from the UNC Chapel Hill.  She is an Assistant Professor of Management in the Organizational Behavior subgroup.  Previously, she served as an Assistant Professor of Strategy at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business and as a Visiting Professor of Business Law at Northwestern University Law School.
Professor McDonnell studies organizational behavior within challenging institutional contexts, such as contentious social environments and uncertain regulatory environments.   Her research draws on organizational theory and political sociology to explore political interactions between corporations and their myriad stakeholders. In particular, she is interested in how a company’s interactions with its stakeholders shape corporate social activity and non-market strategy. Her work also sheds light on the mechanisms that stakeholders use to enforce social norms for corporations and to punish corporate transgressions.  She has published articles in leading peer-reviewed scholarly journals including the Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, the American Sociological Review, Organization Science, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and Psychological Science, as well as law reviews including the Cornell Law Review and the Harvard Human Rights Journal.  Her dissertation won the Best Dissertation Prize from Oxford University’s Centre for Corporate Reputation, and her work was also awarded the Best Paper Prize at the 2014 Strategic Management Society annual conference.  She currently serves on the Editorial Boards of Administrative Science Quarterly, Organization Science, and the Academy of Management Journal.

								Witold J. Henisz is the Deloitte & Touche Professor of Management in Honor of Russell E. Palmer, former Managing Director at The Wharton School, The University of Pennsylvania. He received his Ph.D. in Business and Public Policy from the Haas School of Business at University of California, Berkeley and previously received a M.A. in International Relations from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
His research examines the impact of political hazards on international investment strategy including efforts by multinational corporations to engage in corporate diplomacy to win the hearts and minds of external stakeholders. In a National Science Foundation funded project he showed that markets value stakeholder engagement twice as much as the net present value of the gold ostensibly controlled by 19 publicly traded gold mining companies. He then assessed the contingencies that influence the choice of which stakeholder these firms should reach out to in order to positively influence valuation as well as how to best develop a cooperative relationship with that stakeholder. He draws upon these insights as well as examples from large scale construction management, sustainable tourism, development and military counterinsurgency in his forthcoming (April 2014) book Corporate Diplomacy: Building Reputations and Relationships with External Stakeholders. His earlier work analyzed (1) the political and economic determinants of government attempts to redistribute investor returns to the broader polity; (2) the strategic responses by organizations to such pressure; and (3) the determinants of the success of individual organizations in withstanding such pressure. His research has been published in top-ranked journals in international business (Journal of International Business Studies), management (Academy of Management Review, Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Organization Science, Strategic Management Journal and Strategic Organization), international studies (International Organization and International Studies Quarterly) and sociology (American Sociological Review). This research has been profiled for managers in Harvard Business Review, Brunswick Review, Accountability.org, Motley Fool, TriplePundit, Investor Relations Web Report, The Public Affairs Council, The Penn Gazette and Knowledge@Wharton. He served as a Departmental Editor at The Journal of International Business Studies and is currently an Asssociate Editor at Strategic Management Journal.
Witold has won multiple teaching awards at the undergraduate and graduate levels for his elective courses that highlight the importance of integrating a deep understanding of political and social risk factors into the design of an organization’s global strategy.

Dr. Neil Doherty is the Frederick Ecker Professor Emeritus of Insurance and Risk Management at the Wharton School. He is associated with several of Wharton’s research centers, including the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center and the Financial Institutions Center. A member of the Wharton faculty since 1986, Neil has also consulted with organizations such as Amerco, Dow Chemical, Sears Roebuck, British Petroleum, Merck, GTE, CIGNA, Ace, Aon, Chubb and UPS.
Neil’s principal area of interest is in corporate risk management – focusing on the financial strategies for managing risks that traditionally have been insurable. Such strategies include the use of existing derivatives, the design of new financial products, and the use of capital structure. Neil has written several books in this area including, Corporate Risk Management: A Financial Exposition (1985) and The Financial Theory of Insurance Pricing (1987, with S. D’Arcy) and Integrated Risk Management (2000). A more recent book “The Known, the Unknown and the Unknowable” (2010), (edited jointly with Richard Herring and Frank Diebold) explores the issue in managing the vague and often un-measurable risks such as those that have recently plagued the global economy. He also has written several papers. Many of the ideas developed in his books (e.g., composites of insurance and debt financing and the use of option models in insurance and reinsurance) are now emerging in the marketplace. Neil is also the co-author of the economic textbook, Managerial Economics, 2005.
Two additional areas of focus include:
* the economics of risk and information – he has written several papers on the adverse selection, the value of information, and the design of insurance contracts with imperfect information.
* the failure of insurance markets and how they might be redesigned – in this area, he has written on cyclicality of markets, market crises, and the effect of catastrophes.
Neil coauthored several recent reports dealing with topical insurance issues. One of these The Economics of Insurance Intermediaries (2005) examined the underlying economics of insurance brokers in order to understand the issues raised by Elliot Spitzer’s investigations into this industry. Another TRIA and Beyond, (2005) looked at the market for terrorism insurance and examined the case for Federal Terrorism reinsurance. And a third “At War with the Weather: Managing Large Scale Risks in a New Era of Catastrophes” (with H. Kunreuther and others; 2009, MIT Press) – looks critically at the market for catastrophic risk. Neil is a graduate of the University of York and Cranfield Institute of Technology, where he received his doctorate in Economics.

								Professor Samir Nurmohamed’s research aims to understand the processes and conditions under which individuals can endure, develop, and succeed when they are the targets of adversity. Existing research shows that others’ low expectations are detrimental to the performance of employees and groups within organizations, but he is interested in understanding why and when individuals can derive motivation and develop when others question their capacity to succeed or treat them poorly.
In this vein, his research program spans two primary areas: motivation and initiative. Although much existing theory and research in these areas places a strong emphasis on individuals’ cognitions or organizational and task structures in influencing employees, his research elucidates a social perspective by understanding how employees’ develop and find success when they encounter adversity or negative reactions from others.
Samir (or as he is known to his students and friends, “Nurmo”) teaches the MBA core course on the Foundations of Teamwork and Leadership (MGMT 610), as well as an elective on Power and Politics in Organizations (MGMT 272/772) in the undergraduate, MBA, and executive education programs. At Wharton, he has received several teaching awards, including the Excellence in Teaching for the Undergraduate Division Award and MBA Teaching Commitment and Curricular Innovation Award. You can view his commencement address to undergraduates in 2015 below.
Samir completed his Ph.D. in Management and Organizations at the University of Michigan, and holds his B.A. in Economics and Philosophy from The University of Western Ontario. For fun, he enjoys karaoke-ing to Drake and Kanye, cheering for Toronto and Michigan sports, axe throwing, traveling the globe, and eating at new restaurants in Philly (i.e., the best pound-for-pound food city in America) with his wife, Salimah.
